This workbook and accompanying brief will walk you through how to create a simple survey in Pavlovia.

[Pavlovia](https://pavlovia.org/dashboard?tab=0) is an online platform for hosting surveys and experiments for research.

You should have set up your account this week but if you have any issues with logins let us know.

There is a table of contents on the left to help you navigate this workbook - clicking on a section in the table will take you to the section and display subheadings within this section.
You can also click on pictures to zoom in on them.

## Survey creation {#sec-creation}

Go to [https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/users/sign_in](https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/users/sign_in) and sign into your account.

Once you are signed in, go to the [Pavlovia dashboard](https://pavlovia.org/dashboard?tab=0), where you can see all your account's details.
For the purposes of creating a survey, we are only interested in the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Surveys</code> tab (see the red box in the first picture below). Click on the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Surveys</code> tab to start.

In the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Surveys</code> tab, you will see options to create or import surveys.
Click on the <code style="color: green;">New survey</code> button as shown in the second picture below.

<!-- html code below creates a carousel (using bootstrap stuff) with added lightbox images -->

```

A new window will appear - input a survey name (box 1 in third picture above) and click the <code style="color: green;">Create survey</code> button (box 2) when you're done.

Once your new survey is created, click on it - a green arrow button will appear on the right (see box in fourth picture above).
Click this button to open the survey in a new window to start designing it.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
### Activity

Create a survey in Pavlovia. Give it a name and open it.
:::

## Survey design {#sec-design}

Once you open your new survey, you will be directed to the survey designer as pictured below.

``` {r, fig.cap = "Survey designer", fig.alt = "Survey designer picture: A screenshot of the Pavlovia Survey designer. The screenshot is edited to highlight the question toolbox on the left, the main designer window in the middle, and the survey settings button on the right.", label = "3.1", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("2.1.png")
```

The <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Designer</code> tab provides you with an interface to allow you to click or drag options for your survey.
The main window (displaying the message "The survey is empty. Drag an element from the toolbox or click the button below." in the picture above) is where survey questions are displayed and edited.
On the left is the "toolbox" column, with different question options that you can drag into the main window.

The <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Preview</code> tab is where you can preview your survey as you design it.

The <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Logic</code> tab can be used to set up and see survey logics, which is covered in @sec-consent.

The <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">JSON Editor</code> tab is for advanced editing using the survey's source code (not required here).

All the way to the right is also the Survey settings column (highlighted in the picture), with Undo and Redo arrows to the left of it.

Above that are the survey management buttons:

* Save: click this to save your survey - make sure you do so regularly.
* Undo: click this to undo your last action.
* Download: click this to download your survey, which allows you to import it into Pavlovia and use it in online PsychoPy experiments.

As you edit your survey and click on different components of your survey (pages, questions, etc.), the settings panel will update to display the settings for the corresponding component.

### Survey structure {#sec-structure}

Pavlovia surveys have a specific structure to enable options such as survey logics and branching.

A survey is composed of questions contained in different pages.

Once you add your first question in your survey, new design and structure options will appear (see picture below).

``` {r, fig.cap = "Survey structure", fig.alt = "Survey structure picture: A screenshot of the Pavlovia Survey designer, and specifically of the survey structure. The screenshot is edited to highlight the different survey options.", label = "2.1b", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("2.1b.jpeg")
```

You can change your survey title and add a description (box 1).
These will be seen by the participant and should therefore be clear and informative.

You will also see you now have a Page 1 and a Page 2, which can be renamed (box 2).
These names and descriptions will also be visible to participants.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
### Activity

Click the <code style="color: DodgerBlue;">Add Question</code> button to create your first page.

Make sure your survey's title matches the study title in your brief.

Page 1 of your survey will contain the participant information sheet and consent form. Rename the page to reflect this.

Click the <code style="color: green;">Save</code> button to save your survey. You should do this regularly to avoid losing your progress.
:::

<!-- ::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"} -->
<!-- ### Solution -->

<!-- ![](2.1c.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the Design tab of a new Pavlovia survey. The title of the survey and of the first page have been edited."} -->
<!-- ::: -->

If you click on a page (rather than on a question), you will also see buttons for page options (box 3).
These options are similar to question options:

* Duplicate: Creates a copy of the current page below.
* Settings : Accesses the page settings panel on the right.
* Delete: Deletes the page.

As with questions, the interface looks slightly different on wider displays.
The settings button for pages is not available, and instead the settings panel is automatically open on the right of the interface.

To create a new page, click on the Survey settings button, find the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Pages</code> tab, then click the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">+</code> button to add a new page.
See the recording below for a demonstration.

{{< video survey1.mp4 >}}

<br> Questions within the same page will be displayed to participants at the same time, unless some questions are part of a logic.

### Question types {#sec-qtypes}

There are many question types in Pavlovia surveys, which you can find in the toolbox on the left of the survey designer.

The pictures below show what question types are available.
Clicking the three dots button (red box in the second picture) will display extra question types.

``` {=html}
<div id="carousel2" class="carousel slide" data-ride="false" data-interval="false">
  <ol class="carousel-indicators">
    <li data-target="#carousel2" data-slide-to="0" class="active"></li>
    <li data-target="#carousel2" data-slide-to="1"></li>
  </ol>
  <div class="carousel-inner">
    <div class="carousel-item active">
      <a href="2.2.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Question types"><img src="2.2.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Question types picture: A screenshot of the Pavlovia Survey designer, and specifically the sidebar on the left with the different question types that can be added to the survey." width="960"></a>
      <div class="carousel-caption-below text-center">
        <p>Question types</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
      <a href="2.2b.png" class="lightbox" data-gallery="quarto-lightbox-gallery-1" title="Question types continued"><img src="2.2b.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" alt="Question types continued picture: A screenshot of the Pavlovia Survey designer, and specifically the sidebar on the left with the different question types that can be added to the survey. The screenshot is edited to highlight the 3 dots button which shows the rest of the questions available." width="960"></a>
      <div class="carousel-caption-below text-center">
        <p>Question types continued</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <a class="carousel-control-prev" href="#carousel2" role="button" data-slide="prev">
    <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
  </a>
  <a class="carousel-control-next" href="#carousel2" role="button" data-slide="next">
    <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
  </a>
</div>
```

The question types available are described below, however I recommend playing around with different types to see what suits your needs best.

* Radio Button Group: Multiple-choice question where only one answer is allowed.
* Rating Scale: Single-question, Likert-type scale answer.
* Checkboxes: Multiple-choice question where multiple answers are allowed.
* Dropdown: Multiple-choice question where one answer can be selected from a dropdown menu.
* Multi-Select Dropdown: Multiple-choice question where multiple answers can be selected from a dropdown menu.
* Yes/No (Boolean): Dichotomous answer (e.g. Yes/No) - does not allow for more options.
* File Upload: Allows respondents to upload a file.
* Image Picker: Respondents choose an image or video out of many.
* Ranking: Allows respondent to rank different answers.
* Single-Line Input: Allows for a one-line text entry.
* Long Text: Allows for a multi-line text entry.
* Multiple Textboxes: Creates a question with multiple single-line input textboxes.
* Panel: Creates a form made up of multiple questions of any type.
* Dynamic Panel: Creates a form made up of multiple questions of any type, which can be expanded by the participant.
* Single-Select Matrix: Creates a matrix of multiple-choice questions with the same set of answers - typically used for questionnaires with multiple questions and Likert-type scale answers. Only allows one answer per row.
* Multi-Select Matrix: Same as single-choice matrix but allows multiple answers per row.
* Dynamic Matrix: Used to get a Multiple-Choice Matrix without a column of items.
* HTML: Allows user to create and display text. Typically used to display information and debrief documents or other standalone text (not questions/answers).
* Expression (read-only): Used to calculate a value for later use in the survey - there is no question.
* Image: Displays an image, video or Youtube video (via link) - there is no question.
* Signature: Allows respondents to draw their response.
  
To add a new question, click on <code style="color: DodgerBlue;">Add Question</code> or on any of the question icons in the toolbox.
You can also drag the question icon anywhere on the survey to place a new question where you need in the survey.

Each question has the same structure and options (see picture below):

* The button to move the question around - to move the question to different parts of the survey, just click and hold that button and drag the question to the desired area (box 1).
* The question field, where the question to participants is inserted (box 2).
* The question's content, which will vary based on the question type (box 3). In this case, a radiogroup-type question has been selected and so we see fields for the multiple answers you can create.
* The question type button - this both informs you of the question's type, and allows you to change it to another type. Just click the button and select a different type from the drop-down menu (box 4).
* The question options (box 5) - these 4 buttons allow you to change the question's settings:
  + Duplicate - this allows you to make an exact copy of the question, which will be created below the copied question.
  + Settings - this button opens the settings menu for this question. This is where you will find options to change the name of the question, the questions content (in more detail than what is possible in the main window), the question's logic, settings relating to the question's data, and finally the question's validation.
  + Required - this button makes the question unskippable, as an answer is required from participants to continue with the survey.
  + Delete - deletes the question.

``` {r, fig.cap = "Question structure", fig.alt = "Question structure picture: A screenshot of the Pavlovia Survey designer, and specifically of a newly added question. The screenshot is edited to highlight the different question options explained above.", label = "3.3", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("2.3.jpeg")
```

The interface for questions will look slightly different if you have a wider display.
The settings panel will be open automatically on the right side of the interface, and the settings button present on the question on smaller displays will not be there.
The question toolbox will also display more questions and their names as there is more space on the screen.

### Naming your questions {#sec-names}
If you check under the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">General</code> tab of any question's settings, you will see a box titled <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Name</code>.
Do not ignore this - make sure you give each of your questions a recognisable and understandable short name (for example, your consent form can be named `consent`, and a question on personality might be `perso`).

**Be careful not to use any spaces, punctuation (full stops, commas, etc.) or special characters (&, £, # etc.) as this breaks the survey and it will not record any data.**
For example, `child.consent 2` is not a good name, instead use something like `ChildConsent2`.

Naming your questions will make navigating your survey, and setting up things such as logics much easier, as questions are referenced and referred to by this name within the survey.
Participants cannot see this name, but it will make your life easier.

**Do not change the question name after data collection has started, as this will mess up your final data file.**
The platform will save data from this question under two column titles, the pre-change title of the question, and the post-change title of the question.
This means your data will be split, and if you don't know what the question was called originally, you won't be able to match cases (and will end up with unusable data).
If you need to change the name of your questions but have already started data collection, you will need to make that change in your data file once it has been downloaded.

### Change how a response is recorded {#sec-responses}
In a matrix question's settings, the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Columns</code> and <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Rows</code> tabs will allow you to modify the matrix's columns and rows.
This includes what text participants will see in the matrix's columns and rows (see picture below, box 2), and how a participant's response will be saved as in your final data file (box 1).

``` {r, fig.cap = "Naming matrix columns and rows", fig.alt = "A screenshot of the Pavlovia survey designer, showing the Settings panel for a matrix question. It highlights where to change how a response is saved (box 1) and the text participants will see (box 2).", label = "9.1", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("3.1.PNG")
```

In the example above, participants will see the text on the right (in box 2), and the text on the left (box 1) is how the response will be recorded for that row. 
The same applies to columns.

One way to use this is to record scores rather than text (for example).
If your matrix question is a questionnaire, with a Likert-type scale in the columns, you can put the equivalent score on the left and the appropriate text on the right (e.g. for column 1, you would write `1` in box 1, and `Not at all` in box 2).

The same can be done for the choices of Radio Button Group, Checkboxes, Dropdown, Ranking and Multiple Textboxes questions.
In either type of question's settings, the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Choices</code> tab will have the same structure, with the text on the left being how a response is recorded, and the text on the right being what participants are shown.

## Survey status {#sec-status}

To access your survey's status, click the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Overview</code> tab at the top of the page, to the left of the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Design</code> tab (when opening a survey you will be automatically directed to the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Design</code> tab - see picture below, box 1).

``` {r, fig.cap = "Survey status", fig.alt = "Survey status picture: A screenshot of the survey designer window, highlighting which button to click to access the survey status options.", label = "5.2", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("5.1.png")
```

A Pavlovia survey has 3 statuses, which you can see in the Status area of the Overview page (picture above, box 2):

* <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Inactive</code> - this is the status the survey is on upon creation and by default. Set the survey to this status when you are designing it.
* <code style="color: #D2691E;">Piloting</code> - this is the status you should use to test how your survey is working. You will not be able to share the survey with participants and **data will not be collected**, but will be able to check that your survey is working as intended.
* <code style="color: green;">Running</code> - this is the status used to activate the survey and enable data collection. Setting the survey to running will provide you with a link to share with participants (see picture above, box 3).

<p style="color: red;">You should not collect data from anyone but yourself as you do not have ethical approval to collect data from anyone. </p>

You can move between the different statuses freely, however be aware that moving from the Running status to either of the other two will prevent participants from continuing to run your survey.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
##### Activity

Go to the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Overview</code> tab in your survey and set the status to <code style="color: #D2691E;">PILOTING</code>.
:::

## Making your survey {#sec-content}
<!--
### Survey preview {#sec-preview}
You can see what your survey looks like as you are designing it by clicking on the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Preview</code> tab (next to the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Designer</code> tab, see picture below).

``` {r, fig.cap = "Survey Preview tab", fig.alt = "Survey Preview tab picture: A screenshot of the Pavlovia Survey Preview. The screenshot is edited to highlight where the Preview tab is situated.", label = "4.1", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("4.1.jpeg")
```

There, you will be able to go through your survey to see how it will be presented to participants.
You will also be able to test logics you have put in place.

This is different to piloting your survey, which you can also do to ensure your survey is working the way you want it (this will not enable participants to see the survey, but rather will allow you to test it yourself).
More details on your survey's status (including the Piloting status) can be found in @sec-status.
-->

### Survey testing {#sec-pilot}
You can see what your survey looks like as you are designing it by clicking on the <code style="color: #D2691E;">Pilot</code> button (in the top right corner of the page, see picture below).

``` {r, fig.cap = "Survey Piloting", fig.alt = "Survey Piloting picture: A screenshot of the Pavlovia Survey window. The screenshot is edited to highlight where the Pilot button is found", label = "4.1b", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("4.1b.png")
```

You can pilot your survey to see exactly what your participants will see, to make sure it looks and behaves the way you want it to (this will not enable participants to see the survey, but rather will allow you to test it yourself).
More details on your survey's status (including the Piloting status) can be found in @sec-status.

### Getting informed consent {#sec-consent}

Any surveys you are creating to collect data for a study will need the first page to be an information sheet and consent form for participants to provide informed consent to participate.

Additionally, the survey should automatically end if participants choose not to consent.

Below is a step-by-step guide on how to set this up.
You can find a video walkthrough at the end of this section.

#### Creating the information sheet and consent form {#sec-info}
The first Page of your survey should be the information and consent page.
To create an information sheet, you will need an HTML question to create a question with text that does not require an answer.
Edit the existing question in your first page to an HTML question type in the dropdown menu and name the question.

To create/edit the text of an HTML question, you need to go in that question's settings.
In the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">General</code> tab of these settings, you will find a box titled "HTML markup" - this is where we will copy our information sheet.

However, any text copied as is in this box will lose formatting, as this question requires HTML formatting to have paragraphs or bold/italicised text for example.
You can learn a little bit of HTML to understand how to format your text for Pavlovia [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp), or use a [text to HTML converter](https://wordhtml.com/) to copy in your information sheet from Word, and get the HTML equivalent.
For this workshop, we will use the converter.

To use the converter, copy the information sheet from the research brief and paste it in the text box in the Word tab of the converter.
Edit the areas marked XXXXXX in the information sheet with your details (name, email address).
When using the converter, you may lose some formatting such as bold text or hyperlinks (web links or email addresses).
To remedy this, you can edit the text in the Word tab using the different editing options.
For email addresses, highlight the email address text (for example, jsmith@qmu.ac.uk), click the Insert/edit link button (see red box in picture below), and add the link you want attached to the text in the URL box.
For an email address, the link should be `mailto:email@qmu.ac.uk`.

``` {r, fig.cap = "HTML converter - adding email links", fig.alt = "HTML converter - adding email links picture: A screenshot of the HTML converter. The screenshot is edited to highlight where to find the Insert/edit link button.", label = "4.2", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("4.2.png")
```

The HTML tab of the converter will return the HTML version of the information sheet, which you can copy to add to your survey.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
##### Activity

Follow the instructions above to recreate the Participant Information section of your brief in the text to HTML converter.

Make sure any formatting (bold text, email address links) is reproduced properly in the Word tab of the converter.

Once you're happy, go to the HTML tab of the converter, select all of the text and copy it.

Now that you have the HTML text copied, you can paste it into the "HTML markup" box - you will find it in the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">General</code> tab of your HTML question's settings.
Once you have done this, the HTML question in the survey designer will update with your text.
Please double check that everything looks as you want it.

If your text does not look the way you want, review the text in the Word tab of the converter and make sure everything looks the way you want it.
If you are still having issues, ask for help.

Now that the information sheet is done, you will need to create your consent form below.
The best way to do this is to create another HTML question with all your consent statements, and a second, Radio Button Group question underneath with two options: consent and no consent.
I will walk through how to do this below.

On the same page as your information sheet, create a new question below, select HTML, then give the question a name.
As with the information sheet, you will need to convert the statements in the brief to HTML - copy the statements from the brief, paste them in the converter, then copy the text from the converter's HTML tab.
You can now paste this in the HTML markup box of the question's settings.

Below this question, create a new question and select Radio Button Group, then give it a name.

You will only need 2 items for this question so click on the minus button next to item 3 to delete it.
Now you can edit items 1 and 2 to show the consent options  "Click here if you agree to the above statements" and "Click here if you do not agree to the above statements".

Since this question is related to the statements in the question above, it does not necessarily need a title - to hide the title, navigate to the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Layout</code> tab of the question's settings.
Find the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Title location</code> heading, and select `Hidden` in the dropdown menu below it.
Finally, make sure you make this question required so participants cannot skip it, and save your survey.

<!-- ::: -->

Below is a video walkthrough of the above instructions.
Note some of the text will look different to your brief - the video shows you the steps, not the content.

{{< video example1a.mp4 >}}

#### Creating the skip logic {#sec-skip}

Now that our information sheet and consent form are created, we need to put a skip logic in place so that participants who do not consent are sent to the end of the survey.
To do this, we will redirect participants to a standard end-of-survey screen, which allows participants to complete the survey and saves the responses they did complete (the consent form).

Please make sure that the logic is working before starting testing (i.e. if participants do not consent to participate, they are redirected to the end of the survey). 

Putting this logic in place will depend on how you have set up your consent form (for this example we will use the same set up as in @sec-info).
You can find a video demonstration below, after the text explanation.

First, go to the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Logic</code> tab and click the <code style="color: DodgerBlue;">Add New Rule</code> button.
Once there, we will add a condition for this logic as follows:

<!--
Click the <code style="background-color: RoyalBlue; color: white ">Select</code> button to set which question this logic is dependent on.
Select the question with the consent options (mine is called `consent2`).
Click the <code style="background-color: DarkOrange; color: white ">Equals</code> button as you need to change what state needs to be met for the logic to work.
In this example, we don't want a specific answer ("Click here if you do not agree to the above statements") and we don't want an empty response either, so we need to choose "Does not equal".

You can now select which answer will lead to the survey ending.
Here we want the first answer ("Click here if you agree to the above statements").
We are telling Pavlovia that if a participant's answer is not the first choice (so is either the second choice or empty) then they have not consented and we want them to be directed to the end of the survey.
-->

Click the Manual Entry button, paste this text in: `{block_1/consent2} <> 'Item 1'`.
This text tells Pavlovia that if a participant's answer to the consent question (`{block_1/consent2}`) is not (`<>`) the first choice (`'Item 1'`) (so is either the second choice or empty) then they have not consented and we want them to be directed to the end of the survey.

Now we need to set up what happens when the above conditions are met.
Click the <code style="background-color: Crimson; color: white ">Select action...</code> button and select `Complete survey`.
This means that when participants don't consent, the survey completes rather than continuing to the rest of the questions.

Once this is done, you can click <code style="background-color: DodgerBlue; color: white ">Done</code> and the logic will be set.
<code style="color: green;">Save</code> your survey.

Before we can test whether this works, we will need to create a new page in the survey.
Return to the <code style="color: #4d4d4d;">Designer</code> tab and scroll to the bottom of your survey - you should find a Page 2 there.
Click the <code style="color: DodgerBlue;">Add Question</code> button in Page 2 to create a new question in a new page - you don't need to edit that question yet.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
##### Activity

Follow the instructions above to create the skip logic for participants who do not consent to participate.
Once you're done, <code style="color: #D2691E;">Pilot</code> your survey to check everything works.
:::

<!-- ::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"} -->
<!-- ##### Solution -->

<!-- ![](4.5b.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the Logic tab of a Pavlovia survey. Pictured are the logic settings to skip to the end of the survey if participants do not consent."} -->
<!-- ::: -->

Before sending the survey out, make sure this logic works so you're certain non-consenting participants will not see the rest of your survey.

{{< video example1b.mp4 >}}

### Adding your questions {#sec-questions}

Now that your informed consent is set up, you can return to Page 2 to add your survey questions.

The brief has 3 sections for survey questions:

* About you
* About procrastination
* About learning

Each section should be added to a different Page in your survey.
Each page will then contain the questions included in the relevant section of the brief.

The brief specifies the type of questions you should use - make sure you keep in mind the information in @sec-names and @sec-responses when you are setting up questions.

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
#### Tip

For multiple-choice questions requiring an option for a text answer (e.g. the last option in Q1 of the About you section), once you have created the question you can select the `Other (describe)` option by clicking the <code style="color: DodgerBlue;">+</code> button next to it.
You can then change the text of the option to match the brief.
:::

Certain questions in the brief don't have numerical values (e.g. Q1 or Q4 of the About you section), however you should still set up the responses as explained in @sec-responses.
You can either assign a number between 1 and n (n being the total number of choices in that question), or use the same text as the choice.

For example, in Q1 of the About you section there are 5 choices - you could either set up the responses to numbers (i.e. 1 = "Female" , 2 = "Male", etc.) or use the same text (i.e. "Female" = "Female", "Male" = "Male").

If this doesn't make sense ask for our help.

::: {.callout-warning icon=false}
#### Tip

For multiple-choice questions with a lot of choices (e.g. Q5 of the About you section), you can copy all the choices from the brief, then go in the text box of the first choice of your question in Pavlovia, and paste the choices in - they will come up a separate choices.

This also works for matrix questions - copy all the statements in the first column of the matrix, then go in the text box of the first row of the matrix question in Pavlovia, and paste the choices in.

Make sure you delete any irrelevant items.
:::

Below is a video step-by-step to create a radio button group question to show you how to set up the choices and how they are recorded.

{{< video radio.mp4 >}}

The second video is a similar step-by-step but for matrix questions.

{{< video matrix.mp4 >}}

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
#### Activity

Recreate the brief's sections in Pages 2, 3 and 4 of your survey. Ensure you are naming your questions appropriately and that you have set up the responses properly.

Once you're done, <code style="color: #D2691E;">Pilot</code> your survey to check everything works.
:::
<!--
::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Solution

A fully finished version of the survey has been shared with you. To access it:

* Go to your Dashboard, then click on the Surveys tab
* Find the Access rights column (box 1 below), click on it, and tick the "shared" box (box 2 below)
* Click out of the box - a survey named "X3098 workshop survey - finished version" should appear

Once you open the survey, you will find all the brief questions, set up as needed.

### Adding a debrief sheet {#sec-debrief}

Now that your survey questions are ready, the last thing to add is your debrief sheet.
Scroll down to the bottom of your survey - you should find a Page 5 there.
Rename the page, then click the <code style="color: DodgerBlue;">Add Question</code> button to create a new question in this new page, then change the question type to HTML.

Similarly to how we created our information sheet, we will copy our debrief sheet text and convert it to HTML using the [converter](https://wordtohtml.net/).
Once you have converted the text to HTML, copy and paste it into the HTML question's "HTML markup" box.

As with the information sheet, check to make sure your text has converted properly.
If your text does not look the way you want, review the text in the Word tab of the converter and make sure everything looks the way you want it.
If you are still having issues, ask for help.

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
#### Activity

Following the instructions above, recreate the debrief sheet from the brief using an HTML question.

You should now have your full survey. Before starting testing, make sure your questions are named properly (see @sec-names) and that your responses are recorded properly (see @sec-responses).

Once you're done, <code style="color: #D2691E;">Pilot</code> your survey to check everything works.
