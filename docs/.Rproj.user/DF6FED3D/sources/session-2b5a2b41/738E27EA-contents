This is a guide to using Pavlovia for online surveys, created for Psychology students and staff at Queen Margaret University.

This guide is not exhaustive, and I aim to update it as often as possible, but some information may be out of date due to the pace of development of this software/platform.

Written by Dr Lorna Camus, Psychology Technician at Queen Margaret University.
